# My Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles - they're a work in progress.

## Install

If I'm setting up a new laptop, I like a single command to bootstrap everything. That's the idea of the command and script below -

`curl -o setup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelsainz/dotfiles/initial/setup.sh && chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh -i`
